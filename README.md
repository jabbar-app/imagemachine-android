# imagemachine-android
This is a project for ProSpace's coding challenge.

1. All machine data has been stored locally.  
2. I use zxing's library for qr code reader.
3. At first, I tried to define solution by exploring UX design, you can see my first design of the app at here https://www.figma.com/file/TgvtqK1nmPoVu8j78ftFsG/ProSpace?node-id=0%3A1 but in the end, the final app is a little bit different to adujst with app's functional.
